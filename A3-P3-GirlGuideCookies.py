#Program 3 â€“ Girl Guide Cookies
#Description:   The organizers of the annual Girl Guide cookie sale event want to raise 
#               the stakes on the number of cookies sold and are offering cool prizes to
#               those guides who go above and beyond in their sales efforts. The organizers
#               want a program to print the guide list and their prizes.
